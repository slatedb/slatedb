# Contributing

SlateDB is an open source project and we welcome contributions. Please open Github issues for bugs, feature requests, or other issues. We also welcome pull requests.

Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mHYmGy5MgA) to chat with the developers.

Please follow the instructions in the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

If you plan on making a substantial change, please follow these steps:

1. Open a Github issue
2. If requested, write an RFC (use [0000-template.md](./rfcs/0000-template.md) as a template)
3. Submit incremental PRs that add functionality while moving us toward the goal of the RFC/issue
4. If you feel the need to submit a large PR, submit it as a draft with a bullet-point list of steps to break it into smaller pieces. We will not accept large PRs.

## Contributor License Agreement

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

The CLA text is also available [here](https://gist.github.com/criccomini/5ea2c60fe2ec791d91aa05d165060b9c).

## AI Generated Pull Requests

AI-generated (or largerly generated) pull requests are welcome, provided that you:

- Disclose that the pull request is largely AI generated.
- Specify which tool and model you used.
- Understand the changes in the PR.
- Keep PR descriptions and review replies human.
- Review the code change yourself before submitting the PR.
- Run `/review` locally in the `codex` or `claude` CLI before submitting the PR.
- Follow the guidelines in the PR template (the checkboxes at the bottom).
