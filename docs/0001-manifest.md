# Introduction and requirements

Slate DB operates directly on object stores like S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP and more. It does not have a WAL.

Set of SSTs that are part of the DB should be maintained in remote store. This document proposes a design for maintaining DB state in remote store.<br/>
These two issues have the initial discussions on the topic.

* [#14](https://github.com/slatedb/slatedb/issues/14) Recover DBState from object storage on restart.
* [#16](https://github.com/slatedb/slatedb/issues/16) Read SSTableInfo without loading entire SST.

This issue [here](https://github.com/slatedb/slatedb/issues/20) covers the uses cases for slateDB. All the points there have significant influence on the manifest design.

**Goals for this document are**

1. Describe the design for maintaining DBState in remote store.
    * Design needs to work for the use cases described. Specifically - remote compaction,  multi-reader, fencing mechanism for second writer.
    * It needs to work on at least S3, Azure Blob Storage and GCP. It should limit service depedencies to the SST object store and a store that supports CAS. In some cases, these might be the same store.
    * Reduce API costs on object store.
2. Share the incremental implementation sequence.


# Background on related components
**DBState** <br/>
[DB State](https://github.com/slatedb/slatedb/blob/main/src/db.rs) is the in-memory state of the DB. It contains the following
* A set of mutable memtables and immutable memtables.
* Sequence of L0 SST file meta.
* Set of SST files in other levels. (after compaction is implemented)
* Other potential metadata in the future, for example schema of key & value.

**Flush** : [Flush](https://github.com/slatedb/slatedb/blob/main/src/flush.rs) would periodically create new L0 SST files. These files are part of the persisted DB once the writes succeed.

**Compaction**: Compaction will remove few SST files and add few others. This is in development.<br/>
**Snapshot**: This creates a point-in-time copy of the metadata, and users can read an older state of the DB. This is in development.<br/>
**Fencing**: There is a single writer. When a new writer starts up, old writer's writes should no longer be part of the DB and old writer should shutdown eventually. This is part of manifest design.

# Design


## Metadata

Metadata, including manifest is stored in a store that supports CAS. For a store like ABS, this is achieved by [conditional put](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/specifying-conditional-headers-for-blob-service-operations#Subheading1) with `if-none-match` for the first time and `if-match` afterwards. This section will use such an object store, and a later section will describe implementing the same with a store like DynamoDb.

Metadata is stored in a folder called `_metadata`.  Following are the contents of this folder.

Writer and compactor will have an epoch. New instances will increment the epoch and persist.

**WriterEpoch**
* An integer stored in `_metadata/current_manifest/` file in `writer_start_epochs` property.
* Writers only ever create L0 SST files, and updates `_metadata/current_manifest` on startup.
* On opening the DB in write mode, writer reads the manifest, increments and conditionally appends the new writer info to `_metadata/current_manifest`.
* SST files 
    - L0 files created by writer with epoch `w` are prefixed with `w.`
    - More on this in the L0 files section.
* Writers periodically read `_metadata/current_manifest` file and shutsdown if there has been an update to the writer epoch.

**CompactorEpoch**
* SlateDB expectes to have only one compactor running at any point. Below section helps towards that goal.
* An integer stored in `_metadata/current_manifest.compactor_epoch`.
* On startup, compactor reads, increments and conditionally writes it.
* Modifications done by the compactor are tagged with compactor's epoch number `c`.

**Manifest**
* Contains snapshot prefix of the DB at some point in time.
* Updated by compactor.
* Has the following
    * version: A integer version to handle potential behaviour changes in the future.
    * type: Full / Incremental.
    * base_manifest: string, pointer to base manifest. Null if the type is Full.
    * last_compacted_l0: {writerepoch: integer, sstnumber: integer}
        - only SST files larger `last_compacted_l0` are part of the DB when this manifest is used
    * SSTs: set of SSTInfo. Each SSTInfo has a level, a number and a file name. It is null for `incremental`.
    * Changes: 
        - {deletes: set of deleted ssts (level, number), adds: set of added SSTInfo }
        - null if Type is Full.
    * compactor_epoch: integer
        - this is only for debugging purposes.

* Has the following naming convention `_metadata/manifests/manifest.<compactorepoch>.<randomid>`

**Current Manifest**
* Contains pointer to the current manifest file.
* In a file called `_metadata/current_manifest`.
* Contains the following
    * manifest: string, pointer to the manifest file.
    * writer_epoch_infos:
        - array of { writer_epoch: integer, starting_sst: integer, last_known_sst: integer }
        - last entry is the recent writer.
        - writer appends to this array on restart.
            - on conflict, writer reads the manifest again. If the writer epoch didn't change, attempt the write again. If it did, exit.
        - compactor updates last_known_sst at the beginning of compaction.
        - This approach does have a liveness issue if compactor keeps writing current manifest faster than writer is able to.
    * compactor_epoch: integer
        - On startup, compactor increments and updates it, along with the write to `writer_epoch_infos`.
    * last_writer_info:
        * As an attribute or property of the file, it is not in the content since we might want to update frequently without altering the contents.
        * Updated by writer.
        * Contains: { writer epoch: integer, last_written_l0: integer }
        * This is optional. If available, 
            * Compactor uses it to resolve conflicts between two files for the same sst.
            * If updated by writers, offers better consistency semantics for recent L0 files. 
    * metadata:
        - optional.
        - details are TODO.
        - examples include flush_ms, schema, writer_epoch_refresh_ms, last_compacted_time. 

### DynamoDB as the metadata store
* Dynamo DB supports [Conditional put](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ConditionExpressions.html) and strongly consistent [reads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html). With that, dynamo DB can be one of the meta stores supported.


## Data files

### L0 SSTs
* Are in `l0/` folder.
* Has this naming convention - `{writer epoch}.{sst number}.sst`
    - SST number starts at 0 for each writer epoch and increments by 1.
* On startup, writer does the following.
    - writes the epoch as shared in *current manifest* section.
    - lists all the L0 files, learns the last sst_number.
    - More on this in **recovery** section.

### Other SST files
* These files are under `ssts/` folder.
* There is an optional naming convention, for debugging purposes - `{compactor epoch}.{random sst number}.sst`.
* TODO:- Consider taking advantage of prefix based throughput [improvement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance.html).

## Recovery

**Open DB in read/write mode**

1. Read `_metadata/current_manifest`.
2. Read the `_metadata/manifests/manifest.compactorepoch.<manifestid>` that current_manifest points to. Construct SSTInfo for all levels except L0.
    - Track the `last_compacted_l0`.
3. List all the files under `l0/` folder. Sort them by `{18 digit writer epoch}.{18 digit sst number}` in descending order.
    - Add the files to the list of SST files to read.
    - If uploads happened in parallel, it is possible that there are gaps. On such cases.
        - Wait for a configurable period of time (which can be zero).
        - After the wait, if the file is still not there, remove files added so far and start from the next item in the list.
    - Updates writer epoch as described in *WriterEpoch* section.
    - As it iterates the list, 
        - reject files that are less than `last_compacted_l0.sstnumber`. Assume this is `1.1` for the example later.
        - reject the files that are not the next expected number (current number - 1). This will eliminate files written by zombie writers.
        - Example:
            - Consider this sequence of operations {writerepoch.sstnumber} : [1.1, 1.2, new writer 2 starts, 1.3, both writers hit a network outage of 10 seconds, writer 2 writes empty 2.3, 1.3, 1.4, 2.4, 2.5, new writer 3 starts, 2.6, 3.6, 3.7]
            - Following would be set of ssts to be added: [3.7, 3.6, 2.5, 2.4, 2.3, 1.2]
                - 1.1 is not part of it, because it <= `last_compacted_l0`.
                - Even though 1.3 was written, it will not be part of the DB (as expected) since `current_manifest/writer_start_epochs` has the entry `{writer_epoch: 2, starting_sst: 3}`
            - For the same example, consider a compactor starting after 1.3, before 2.3
                - 1.3 will not be part of the manifest.
                - Subsequent clients that read from manifest will include 1.3. 
                - 1.3 and 1.4 will be lost. 
4. Pass the list of l0 files to be loaded to DB. DB does the following.
    - Starts a task to read SSTInfo for these files and add it to the end of L0 list.
    - Tracks this task, and blocks reads that need these files.
    - Errors out reads if the task fails.
    - Writes and reads for newly written data is unblocked at this point.
5. DB periodically checks `_metadata/current_manifest` and fails reads and writes if writer epoch changed.

**Open DB in read only mode**

1. Steps will be similar to read/write mode.
2. Steps 1,2,3,4 from write mode. In step 2, skip the writer epoch increment step.
3. Store the last L0 number in addition.
4. get_changes
    - Periodically, repeat step 2 to get new files.

## Compaction updates to manifest

Details on how compaction will be done is out of scope for this document. This section covers just the manifest read & write aspects of it.

1. Increment and update `_metadata/compactorepoch`.
2. Open DB in read only mode. 
3. Update `_metadata/current_manifest.writer_epoch_infos` with the last known sst_number for the current writer. Only compact until this L0.
4. Compact - this will result in new SSTs added, and some marked for deletion. In memory state will be updated. 
5. Create a new manifest. Details to be included are in **Manifest** section. 
6. Read and conditionaly update `_metadata/current_manifest`. These would be the updates
    * manifest: file name from step 5.
    * writer_epoch_infos: Array with single element, retrieved in step 3.
    * On write conflict, read again. 
        * If the only change is a new writer, add the new writer to `writer_epoch_infos` and attempt the write again.
        * If another compactor updated it, exit.
7. Run get_changes from previous section periodically, and repeat steps 3-6  again if necessary.

**Size calculations for manifest file**

Summary: 
* For about 50 GB of data with 1000 writes per second, for 10kb key and 100 kb values, manifest size will be ~16 MB and every minute there will be 1MB of meta data updates.
* This is an approximation. With this doubling, metadata writes should still be manageable.


|RowId|Description| Expression| Value|
|------|----|----|---|
|A|Block size in MB| A |32|
|B|DB Size in GB| B| 50|
|C|Number of blocks| B * 1024 / A| 1600|
|D|Size of key in KB|D|10|

## Create and read snapshot

1. Read `_metadata/current_manifest` to get the current manifest. Say the file is `manifest.compactorepoch7.100`. If the DB is already open, this value will already be in the memory.
2. Run step 5 of *Open DB in read/write mode*, get the last L0 file.
3. Write a `_metadata/snapshots/manifest.compactorepoch7.100.<random_snapshot_id>` file, marking that a snapshot exists. Write the following in the file.
    - last L0 file to include: string, file retreived in step 2.
    - expiry: integer, epochseconds after which the snapshot may be deleted.
4. Open DB in read only mode, pass above manifest, a last L0 file and disable `get_changes`.
5. Delete the snapshot file when done.

## Garbage collection

Deletes the SST files that are not part of the table any more.

1. List `_metadata/snapshots/` and delete the ones that have expired. Add a configurable buffer to account for clock skews.
2. Read `_metadata/current_manifest` and all the manifests in `_metadata/snapshots/` to construct the files are part of the table.
3. For L1+ files, Delete data files that are marked for deletion and are not part of any snapshots. 
4. For L0 files, delete all files lower than the lowest one refered to by current_manifest or a snapshot.
5. List the files under `_metadata/manifests/` and delete the ones that are not part of snapshots, is not the current manifest, and created before a configurable interval.

## Consistency semantics

1. Writes included in manifest are fully committed, they will always be part of the DB.
2. Writes flushed to l0, but not included in the manifest yet may not be included in the DB if another writer invalidates the writes with epoch increment.
    - For additional guarantees, update `_metadata/current_manifest.last_writer_info` periodically.
        - TODO:- Update behavior for write mode and read mode for the stronger consistency.
        - Frequent updates does cause a race (i.e. potential liveness issue) between compactor and writer, since they update the same key.

# Implementation sequence proposal

1. Implement the rules for L0, without fencing.
2. Design consensus.
3. Add the store interface for metadata, add writer fencing logic.
4. Compaction gets implemented separately.
5. Manifest Reads/Writes with compaction, for full manifests.
6. Snapshots.
7. Garbage collection.
8. Incremental manifests.
