# SlateDB Error API

Status: Draft

Authors:

* [Jason Gustafson](https://github.com/hachikuji)

## Motivation

Errors exposed through a public API are part of the public API. Users depend on clearly
documented errors to drive failure handling logic and we cannot change them without considering
how it affects compatibility. It is important to have common agreement among contributors
about the guidelines to expose new public errors.

## Goals

The goal of this RFC is to establish a set of principles for exposing public errors
and a framework for maintaining them.

## Principles

- **Errors should not expose implementation.** The intent is to reserve 
enough space for the implementation to change without affecting the public API.
- **Errors should be prescriptive.** Ideally it should be clear to the user what they need to do
to resolve an issue. For example, we should indicate whether a failure may be transient and
an operation can be retried. It may not always be possible to have clear guidance for 
unexpected errors, but ideally we can at least state whether the error is fatal.
- **Prefer coarse error types.** A useful criteria to decide whether a new error type is needed 
is whether the user would handle it differently than one of the existing types. 
- **Use rich error messages.** Pack as much information as is needed to diagnose a problem
into the error message, which will not be considered part of the public API.

## Public API

Publicly exposed errors will be maintained in `slatedb::Error`. Each new error type must be documented
in this RFC. All public APIs will document the complete set of errors that may be returned. 

Each exposed error type will expose documentation which contains a general description
of the error and contains any prescriptive guidance (such as indicating whether a failed 
operation can  be retried or is fatal).

Each error type will also expose a custom message field which is used to convey details about the specific
instance of the error that was encountered. Unlike the error type, the message is not part of the 
public API and can be changed without notice. The intent is to pack as much detail into the message
for someone to understand the root cause, and if possible, what they should do to resolve it.

The complete set of public error types are listed below:

```rust
mod slatedb {
  use std::time::Duration;

  #[derive(Clone, Debug, Error)]
  pub enum Error {
    /// The application attempted an invalid operation or an operation with an
    /// invalid parameter (including misconfiguration).
    #[error("Operation Error: {msg}")]
    OperationError { msg: String },

    /// Unexpected internal error. This error is fatal (i.e. the database must be closed).
    #[error("System Error: {msg}")]
    SystemError { msg: String },

    /// Invalid persistent state (e.g. corrupted data files). The state must 
    /// be repaired before the database can be restarted.
    #[error("Persistent Error: {msg}")]
    PersistentError { msg: String },

    /// Failed access database resources (e.g. remote storage) due to some 
    /// kind of authentication or authorization error. The operation can be 
    /// retried after the permission issue is resolved.
    #[error("Permission Error: {msg}")]
    PermissionError { msg: String },

    /// The operation failed due to a transient error (such as IO unavailability). 
    /// The operation can be retried after backing off.
    #[error("Transient Error: {msg}. Backoff {backoff} before retrying.")]
    TransientError { msg: String, backoff: Duration },

    /// An operation failed during a transaction. The transaction can be aborted
    /// and the operation can be retried.
    #[error("Transaction Error: {msg}")]
    TransactionError { msg: String },
  }
}
```

New errors can be added by updating this RFC. Existing errors can be removed through semantic 
versioning. Typically, the need to remove an error suggests that some part of the internal 
implementation has been inadvertently leaked, so such cases should be rare if the exposed 
errors follow the principles above.
