description: A high-level overview of LSM trees and SlateDBâ€™s design
---

SlateDB is a log-structured merge-tree (LSM tree). You must understand how LSM trees work to understand SlateDB's design.

Let's take a look at a typical LSM tree design.

## Log-Structured Merge-Trees

The following diagram shows a typical LSM tree design:

  %% High-level LSM components

  subgraph Levels
    direction TB
    subgraph L0 [L0]
      L0_SST2["SSTable 2"]
      L0_SST1["SSTable 1"]
      L0_SST0["SSTable 0"]
    end
    subgraph L1 [L1]
      L1_SST1["SSTable 1"]
      L1_SST0["SSTable 0"]
    end
  end

  subgraph Write Path
    C[Client] --> WAL["Write-Ahead Log (WAL)"]
    C --> MT["Memtable (mutable)"]
    C --> MANIFEST["Manifest"]
    MT -->|rotate| IMT["Memtable (immutable)"]
    IMT -->|flush| L0_SST2
  end

  L0_SST0 -->|compaction| L1_SST1
  L0_SST1 -->|compaction| L1_SST1
```
