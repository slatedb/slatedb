title: Files

SlateDB persists data in object storage under three main directories:

* `manifest`: Contains manifest files representing the database state.
* `wal`: Contains immutable write-ahead log segments as SSTables.
* `compacted`: Contains SSTables for each sorted run, representing durable, readable data.

The directory structure looks like:

```
some-dir/
├─ manifest/
│  ├─ 00000000000000000001.manifest
│  ├─ 00000000000000000002.manifest
│  └─ ...
├─ wal/
│  ├─ 00000000000000000001.sst
│  ├─ 00000000000000000002.sst
│  └─ ...
└─ compacted/
   ├─ 01K3XYV1W2WR4FDVB7A9S319YS.sst
   ├─ 01K3XYV9JFPSZ5BW3Y1DVMKDFS.sst
   └─ ...
```

All three folders reside in the same object store bucket and path prefix by default. The WAL can be configured to point to a separate bucket. See the [Writes](/docs/design/writes) page for details.

:::note

SlateDB does not write to local disk at all. Users can configure disk config disk-backed block, index, filter, and object store file caches. See [Caching](/docs/design/caching) for details.
