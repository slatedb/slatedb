SlateDB's performance characteristics are primarily determined by the object store being used. This page provides guidance on expected performance and how to tune SlateDB for your use case.

## Latency

SlateDB's write latency is dominated by object store PUT operations. The following table shows expected latencies for different object stores:

| Object Store | Expected Write Latency | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| S3 Standard | 50-100ms | Network latency dominates |
| S3 Express One Zone | 5-10ms | Single-digit millisecond latency |
| Google Cloud Storage | 50-100ms | Network latency dominates |
| Azure Blob Storage | 50-100ms | Network latency dominates |
| MinIO | 5-20ms | Depends on network and disk |

Read latency dominated by the database's working set size and read pattern:

1. Working sets that fit in local (memorya and disk) caches will respond very quickly (< 1ms).
2. Read patterns that do sequential reads will respond very quickly (&lt;1ms) since SST blocks are pre-fetched sequentially and cached locally.
3. Read patterns that access keys that are (lexicographically) close to each other will respond very quickly (< 1ms) since blocks are cached locally after the first read.
4. Reads that access data across the keyspace, and whose dataset is larger than a single machine's memory or disk will, are more likely to see latency spikes similar to object storage latency levels (50-100ms for S3 standard). Such workloads can still work well, but require more tuning, partitioning, and so on.

## Throughput

SlateDB's write throughput is limited by:

1. **Object store PUT rate limits**: Most object stores limit PUT operations to 3,500 requests per second per prefix.
2. **Network bandwidth**: The time it takes to upload SSTs to object storage.

Read throughput is limited by:

1. **Object store GET rate limits**: Most object stores limit GET operations to 5,500 requests per second per prefix.
2. **Network bandwidth**: The time it takes to download SSTs from object storage.
3. **Disk I/O**: The time it takes to read SSTs from disk when object store caching or [Foyer hybrid caching](https://foyer.rs/docs/tutorial/hybrid-cache) are enabled.

## Tuning

SlateDB provides several configuration options to tune performance. See [Settings](https://docs.rs/slatedb/0.7.0/slatedb/config/struct.Settings.html) for a complete reference.

### Write Performance

* **`flush_ms`**: The time to wait before flushing the mutable WAL to object storage. Lower values reduce write latency but increase object store PUT frequency.
* **`l0_sst_size_bytes`**: The size of L0 SSTs. Larger SSTs provide better compression but take longer to upload.
* **`max_unflushed_memtable`**: The maximum number of unflushed memtables. Lower values reduce memory usage but may increase write latency.

### Read Performance

* **`bloom_filter_false_positive_rate`**: The false positive rate for bloom filters. Lower values reduce unnecessary SST reads but increase bloom filter size.
* **`block_size`**: The size of blocks within SSTs. Larger blocks provide better compression but take longer to read individual keys.

### Memory Usage

* **`max_memtable_size_bytes`**: The maximum size of the in-memory memtable. Lower values reduce memory usage but may increase write latency.
* **`max_unflushed_memtable`**: The maximum number of unflushed memtables. Lower values reduce memory usage but may increase write latency.
