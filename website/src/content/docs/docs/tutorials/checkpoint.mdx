## Creating a Checkpoint

To create a checkpoint, use the `create_checkpoint` function provided by SlateDB.  
This operation captures a consistent and durable view of the database state, anchored to a specific manifest version.

<Code code={createCheckpoint} lang="rust" title="main.rs" />

## Refreshing a Checkpoint

To extend the lifetime of an existing checkpoint, use `Db::refresh_checkpoint`. 
This updates the checkpointâ€™s expiration time, ensuring that the referenced SSTs remain protected from garbage collection for the specified duration.

<Code code={refreshCheckpoint} lang="rust" title="main.rs" />

## Deleting a Checkpoint

To remove a checkpoint, use `Db::delete_checkpoint`. 
This deletes the checkpoint metadata from the manifest, allowing the garbage collector to eventually reclaim any unreferenced SST files associated with that checkpoint.

<Code code={deleteCheckpoint} lang="rust" title="main.rs" />
