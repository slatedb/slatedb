title: Quick Start
description: Get started with SlateDB in minutes
---

SlateDB is a Rust library. It doesn't currently ship with any language bindings, so you must use Rust or generate your own bindings.

## Installation

Add the following depedencies to your project:

```bash
cargo add slatedb tokio --features tokio/macros
```

## Usage

SlateDB uses [`tokio`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) as its async runtime and [`object_store`](https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/) to interact with object storage. The code below shows a simple in-memory example.

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import fullExample from '/../slatedb/examples/full_example.rs?raw'

<Code code={fullExample} lang="rust" title="main.rs" />
