//! # Subcompactions
//!
//! In-memory record of a subcompaction (RFC-0028): a compaction over a
//! sub-range of a parent compaction's key space (see [`Subcompaction`]), plus
//! the boundary-selection planner ([`plan_subcompaction_ranges`]) that decides
//! how to split a logical compaction into those sub-ranges.
//!
//! The overall approach mirrors RocksDB's subcompaction boundary selection; see
//! `ApproximateKeyAnchors` and `GenSubcompactionBoundaries` in RocksDB's
