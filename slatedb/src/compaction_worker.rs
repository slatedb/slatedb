//! Distributed-compaction worker (RFC-0025).
//!
//! A [`CompactionWorker`] polls `.compactions` for `Scheduled` entries, claims
//! them via the optimistic CAS protocol described in RFC-0025, executes the
//! compaction with the same code path the in-process executor uses, and writes
//! `Compacted` (with the produced output recorded on the job's subcompaction)
//! back to `.compactions`. The coordinator separately observes those
//! `Compacted` entries and commits the manifest update (see
//! [`crate::compactor::CompactorEventHandler::commit_compacted_entries`]).
//!
//! # Deployment patterns
//!
//! Workers run in one of two modes:
//!
//! 1. **Embedded with Hybrid Optionality** a single worker is spawned inside the compaction coordinator's process. (
//!    The coordinator must have `worker: Some(CompactionWorkerOptions))` in its [`crate::config::CompactorOptions`].
//!    This is the default. Additional (non-embedded) workers may be started in addition to the embedded worker to
//!    satisfy scaling needs. This doesn't cause fencing and is an intended usage pattern.
//!
//! 2. **Standalone**: The compaction coordinator runs without an embedded worker and one or
//!    more separate worker processes each run a [`CompactionWorker`]. The coordinator must
//!    have `worker: None` in its [`crate::config::CompactorOptions`].
//!
//! # Heartbeat and failure detection
//!
//! Workers emit heartbeats to prove liveness. A heartbeat is a CAS write that
//! bumps `last_heartbeat_ms` in the worker's `.compactions` entry. Every
//! `heartbeat_interval`, the worker refreshes liveness for every active
//! job it still owns and publishes the latest compaction context reported by
//! the executor (the plan and each range's output SSTs), so a reclaiming
//! worker can resume completed ranges. The heartbeat ticker is the only path
//! that writes worker progress; executor progress reports are buffered in
//! memory until the next tick.
//!
//! The coordinator reclaims stale Running compactions whose
//! `last_heartbeat_ms` is older than
//! [`crate::config::CompactorOptions::worker_heartbeat_timeout`].
//! Reclaimed jobs resume from their last persisted state (`output_ssts`) when the
//! next worker picks them up.
//!
//! # Metrics
//!
//! Workers emit the following per-worker metrics labeled `{worker_id=<id>}`:
//!
//! | Metric | Description |
//! |---|---|
//! | `slatedb.compactor.bytes_compacted` | Bytes merged by this worker |
//! | `slatedb.compactor.running_compactions` | Jobs currently in-flight |
//! | `slatedb.compactor.ssts_written` | Output SSTs produced |
//!
//! Supply a recorder via [`CompactionWorkerBuilder::with_metrics_recorder`].
//! The coordinator emits complementary metrics (`jobs_claimed`, `jobs_reclaimed`,
//! `worker_last_heartbeat_ms`) on its own recorder.
