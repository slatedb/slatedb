//! Compactor Orchestration and Naming Overview
//!
//! This module implements the event loop ("compactor") that orchestrates database
//! compactions. It coordinates three concerns:
//!
//! 1. deciding what to compact,
//! 2. executing the work,
//! 3. and persisting the effects.
//!
//! The key types follow a consistent naming hierarchy to distinguish “what should happen”
//! from “what is currently running”.
//!
//! Naming hierarchy (logical → runtime):
//! - [`CompactionSpec`]: Description of a compaction to perform. Pure specification of
//!   inputs and destination (e.g., L0 SST ULIDs and/or Sorted Run ids → destination SR id).
//! - [`Compaction`]: A concrete compaction entity the system decided to run. It has a
//!   stable id (ULID) and references a [`CompactionSpec`]. Compactions live in the
//!   process-local [`CompactorState`] and represent the lifecycle of a single planned
//!   transformation of the DB’s structure. Today each [`Compaction`] has exactly one
//!   runtime job; future retries would attach multiple jobs to a single [`Compaction`].
//! - Compaction Job: A single job attempt the executor runs. Currently there isn't a separate model
//!   type that tracks the Compaction Job entity. When starting a job the compactor creates a
//!   [`StartCompactionJobArgs`] instance which materializes the execution-time inputs (opened
//!   SST handles and Sorted Runs), carries runtime context like the logical compaction clock tick,
//!   and sends this to the executor.
//!   Currently there is a 1:1 mapping between [`Compaction`] and a Compaction Job, but
//!   if retries are introduced, multiple Compaction Jobs would be associated with a single
//!   [`Compaction`].
//!
//! Roles:
//! - [`CompactionScheduler`]: Policy that proposes [`CompactionSpec`] values based on the
//!   current [`CompactorState`] (e.g., size-tiered scheduling). It validates logical
//!   invariants (such as consecutive sources and destination rules).
//! - [`CompactionExecutor`]: Runs [`CompactionJobSpec`] attempts, merges inputs, applies
//!   merge and retention logic, writes output SSTs, and reports progress/finish.
//! - [`CompactorEventHandler`]: Event-driven controller. It polls the manifest, asks
//!   the scheduler for new [`CompactionSpec`] proposals, registers [`Compaction`] entities,
//!   spawns [`CompactionJobSpec`] attempts on the executor, and persists results by
//!   updating the manifest.
//!
//! Progress and GC safety:
//! - Progress is tracked per compaction as `bytes_processed` (approximate, for observability).
//! - The lowest start time among active compaction ids (ULIDs) is exported as a
//!   “low-watermark” hint so GC can avoid deleting inputs required by running work.
//!
//! High-level flow:
//! 1) Poll manifest and merge remote state into local [`CompactorState`].
//! 2) Ask the [`CompactionScheduler`] for candidate [`CompactionSpec`] values.
//! 3) For each accepted spec, create a [`Compaction`] (id + spec), derive a
//!    [`StartCompactionJobArgs`] with concrete inputs, and pass it to the executor.
//! 4) Upon completion, update [`CompactorState`], write a new manifest, and repeat.
//!
//! These names are used consistently across modules so it is clear whether a type
//! represents a description (Spec), a durable decision (Compaction), or a running
//! attempt (JobSpec).
