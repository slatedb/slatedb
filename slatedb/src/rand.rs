#![allow(clippy::disallowed_types)]

//! SlateDB's module for generating random data.
//!
//! This module exists because we want to do deterministic simulation testing
//! for SlateDB. To do so, we need a way to easily seed all random number
//! generators (RNGs) in the library in a deterministic way.
//!
//! The module currently uses Xoshiro128++ for all random number generators. The
//! rand crate's `seed_from_u64` method uses SplitMix64 under the hood, which
//! makes it safe to use when creating new thread-local RNGs.

use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering};

use rand::RngCore;
use rand::SeedableRng;
use rand_xoshiro::Xoroshiro128PlusPlus;
use thread_local::ThreadLocal;

type RngAlg = Xoroshiro128PlusPlus;

/// A shareable, lock-free random number generator (RNG).
///
/// This is a wrapper around `ThreadLocal<RngAlg>` that provides a thread-local
/// random number generator for each thread. If a custom seed is provided,
/// each thread will be seeded deterministically from the seed, and the seed will
/// be incremented for the next thread.
///
/// Note that if there is more than one thread, the RNG's behavior is still
/// non-deterministic since it depends on which thread is scheduled first by the
/// OS scheduler. Only one thread must be used for the entire SlateDB runtime if
/// deterministic behavior is desired.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```ignore
/// use slate_db::rand::DbRand;
///
/// let rng = DbRand::new(42);
/// let _ = rng.next_u64();
/// ```
