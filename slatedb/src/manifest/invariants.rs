/// Invariant 1 — L0 ULID cutoff. Every L0 SST newly added by `dirty` must carry a
/// physical SST ULID timestamp **not below** the current manifest's L0 watermark
/// (`current.core.max_l0_ulid_timestamp_across_trees()`) — i.e. it must be `>=`
/// the watermark; only a strictly-below timestamp is rejected.
///
/// The comparison deliberately matches the GC's deletion filter, which deletes
/// SSTs *strictly older* than the cutoff (`sst.datetime() < cutoff_dt`, at
/// millisecond granularity) — so an SST whose timestamp equals the watermark
/// survives the GC and is safe to publish. Allowing equality also means two L0s
/// minted in the same millisecond both pass, which keeps the writer's retry path
/// from spinning on same-millisecond ULID collisions; only a genuine backwards
/// clock step (timestamp strictly below the watermark) trips the invariant.
///
/// The check uses the physical SST ULID — `view.sst.id.unwrap_compacted_id()` —
/// **not** the separately-allocated `view.id`. The GC keys its cutoff and its
/// deletion filter off the SST ULID (see `garbage_collector::compacted_gc`), and
/// in the normal V2 path the SST ULID is minted at upload while the `view.id` is
/// minted later when the view is added to the manifest. Validating `view.id`
/// would miss a backwards-skewed *upload*: an SST minted below the GC cutoff could
/// receive a fresh `view.id` above the watermark, pass this check, and still be
/// eligible for deletion. So both the watermark and this comparison are based on
/// the SST ULID.
///
/// This guarantees a newly published L0 is not behind any L0 the GC may have
/// already fenced, so a writer on a backwards-skewed wall clock cannot publish an
/// SST whose ULID falls below the GC cutoff — which could otherwise make a live
/// SST eligible for deletion and corrupt the database state.
///
/// "Newly added" is the set of L0 SST ULIDs present in `dirty` but absent from
/// `current`, so re-publishing existing L0s (an idempotent update) never fails
/// the check. On violation, returns [`SlateDBError::InvalidClockTick`] with the
/// watermark timestamp as `last_tick` and the offending ULID timestamp as
/// `next_tick`. The txn-obj layer wraps the boxed error in `CallbackError`, which
/// maps back to `SlateDBError::InvalidClockTick` for the caller.
