//! # Batch Write
//!
//! This module adds batch write functionality to DbInner. Prior to this feature,
//! writes were performed directly in DbInner's `put_with_options` and
//! `delete_with_options` methods. For each operation, a lock was acquired on the
//! db_state to mutate the WAL or memtable. This worked fine for single writes,
//! but for batch writes, which take longer, it could create contention on the lock
//! because. This is dangerous in an async runtime because it can block the
//! threads, leading to starvation.
//!
//! This module spawns a separate task to handle batch writes. The task receives
//! a `WriteBatchMsg``, which contains a `WriteBatchRequest``. The `WriteBatchRequest`
//! contains a `WriteBatch` containing Put/Delete operations and a `oneshot::Sender`.
//! The `Sender` is used to send the table that the batch was written to back to the
//! caller so the caller can `.await` the result. The result is that callers safely
//! `.await` on their writes rather than holding a lock on the db_state.
//!
//! Centralizing the writes in a single event loop also provides a single location to
//! assign sequence numbers when we implement MVCC.
//!
//! [Pebble](https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble) has a similar design and
//! [a good write-up](https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble/blob/master/docs/rocksdb.md#commit-pipeline)
//! describing its benefits.
//!
//! _Note: The `write_batch` loop still holds a lock on the db_state. There can still
//! be contention between `get`s, which holds a lock, and the write loop._
