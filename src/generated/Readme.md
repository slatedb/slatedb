# FlatBuffers Generated Code

This folder contains the generated [flatbuffer](https://flatbuffers.dev/) code. Flat buffer schemas are in the root `schemas` folder.

## How to Generate FlatBuffers Rust Code

To generate `.rs` files from `.fbs` files:

1. Install [flatc](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers).
2. Run `flatc -o src/generated --rust schemas/sst.fbs` from the project root.

_NOTE: You can install it with `brew install flatbuffers` if you're using Homebrew._
