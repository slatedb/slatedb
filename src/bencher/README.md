# SlateDB Benchmarking Tool

Bencher is a tool for benchmarking SlateDB. The tool currently has only one
subcommand: `db`.

## `db` Subcommand

The `db` subcommand is used to benchmark SlateDB. It can be used to measure the
puts and gets per-second on a SlateDB database. The subcommand takes the following
arguments:

```
Usage: bencher db [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --db-options-path <FILE_PATH>
          Options path to a file with options for DbOptions, `SlateDb.toml` is used if this flag is not set.
      --block-cache-size <BLOCK_CACHE_SIZE>
          The size in bytes of the block cache.
      --duration <DURATION>
          The duration in seconds to run the benchmark for.
      --key-generator <KEY_GENERATOR>
          The key generator to use. [default: Random] [possible values: Random, FixedSet]
      --key-len <KEY_LEN>
          The length of the keys to generate in bytes. [default: 16]
      --key-count <KEY_COUNT>
          The number of keys to use for FixedSet key generator. [default: 100_000]
      --await-durable
          Whether to await durable writes.
      --concurrency <CONCURRENCY>
          The number of read/write to spawn. [default: 4]
      --num-rows <NUM_ROWS>
          The number of rows to write.
      --val-len <VAL_LEN>
          The length of the values to generate in bytes. [default: 1024]
      --put-percentage <PUT_PERCENTAGE>
          The percentage of writes to perform in each task. [default: 20]
      -h, --help
          Print help
```

The following command runs the benchmark for 120 seconds:

```bash
cargo run -r --bin bencher --features="bencher" -- db --duration 120
```

If you're using the AWS cloud provider (`CLOUD_PROVIDER=aws`), make sure to set up the
following environment variables before benchmarking:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`
- `AWS_BUCKET`
- `AWS_DYNAMODB_TABLE`, see
  [DynamoCommit](https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/aws/struct.DynamoCommit.html)
  for more details.
- `AWS_ENDPOINT` (optional), if you are using a custom S3 endpoint.
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional), if you are using temporary credentials. 

### Plotting Results

There is also a shell script which runs a series of benchmarks and then draws
the plots using `gnuplot`. Think of it as a template to start with to create
a set of benchmarks suitable for your task. The script should be run from
the repository root:

```bash
./src/bencher/benchmark-db.sh
```

The command above will produce results at `target/bencher/results` directory. 

## `compaction` Subcommand

The `compaction` subcommand is used to benchmark the compaction process in SlateDB.
There are three subcommands:

```
Usage: bencher compaction <COMMAND>

Commands:
  load   Load test data.
  run    Run a compaction.
  clear  Clear test data.
  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

A typical flow would load test data, run the compaction, then clear the test data:

```bash
cargo run -r --bin bencher --features="bencher" -- compaction load
cargo run -r --bin bencher --features="bencher" -- compaction run
cargo run -r --bin bencher --features="bencher" -- compaction clear
```

See individual subcommands for more details.

The compaction benchmarking tool can also be used to compact specific SSTables
rather than the generated test data. To do this, set the `--compaction-sources`
argument:

```bash
cargo run --bin bencher --features="bencher" -- compaction run --compaction-sources="1,2"
```
